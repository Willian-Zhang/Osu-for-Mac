Thanks for showing interest in making a skin!

A few things to note:

1. If you don't change any of the sprites, please delete the template copy.  If a file is not present, the osu! default will be used (and loaded much faster than if you leave the png in your skin :).

2. The following sprites should be *greyscale* only, as they get colourised in-game.  The colour filter is subtractive, meaning if you make something black it will always be black.  Therefore, lighter shades usually work better.

* hitcircle.png
* menu-button-background.png
* playfield.png

While I urge you to follow the size restrictions I have placed on the sprites, it is possible to alter the actual png sizes.  Don't go too crazy, though.
